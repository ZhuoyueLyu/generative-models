# MNIST \& MIDI 
The driver files that train the ACAI models are MNIST_ACAI.py or MIDI_ACAI under respective folders. 

The MIDI_parse.py won't run. It takes the clean_midi folder from the Lakh dataset and extract several piano notes from midi files. 
But the clean_midi folder is too large for github.
